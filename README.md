# Note! This library is in development / alpha and should not be used in your production projects. It may not even work. Also, you probably want a different carousel like nuka-carousel, anyway.

# react-simple-carousel

A simple carousel component for React using gestures and React Spring.

## Why another carousel component?

This project has two purposes, both completely self-serving:

1. To meet the exact needs of a slider that I needed for a client project. nuka-carousel was acting buggy in this particular case, and after trouble shooting and trying other components for a while, I decided to build my own.
2. To get practice using React Spring.

That's it. _Really._

Do we need another carousel component? No.
Is this one necessarily better carousel component x? Probably not, but it works on the client project I'm using it for, and it meets my exact specifications.

I do plan on continuing to develop this as need be, and hopefully add some more details on installation/usage, but there are no big plans to maintain this project once my client project is finished.

If you're reading this and for some reason bigger, better carousels don't work for you, then I hope that this little component helps you out!
